# Backend-flask
## Instructions to run
On a machine having docker run the following command. This is a public repository so it should work fine.
> docker pull amritrv/dockerhub:backend-flask

I used postman to send/receive GET/POST requests to test the same. I have used flask to create the backend. 
After pulling the docker image use the below command to run the server.
> docker run amritrv/dockerhub:backend-flask


Post the above, use GET and POST commands to get the details.
